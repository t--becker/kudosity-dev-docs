    In RCS Business Messaging, an agent is the branded, verified identity that
    customers see when they receive messages, while the sender or number is the
    mechanism through which messages are delivered; agents serve as digital
    storefronts for brands, offering various functionalities like customer
    support, marketing, and transactional interactions.

An RCS Agent, also known as an RCS Sender Agent, is the digital identity that represents a brand in a customer’s RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging experience. Similar to a Sender ID (like a short code or long code) in SMS, an RCS Agent provides an enhanced, branded interface where customers and brands can interact within the RCS messaging platform.

## 🆔 Agent vs Sender vs Number: What's the Difference?

In RCS Business Messaging, it’s easy to get mixed up between agents, senders, and numbers — especially since each plays a different role in how messages are delivered and displayed.

Here’s how it works in Kudosity’s RCS platform:

### 🤖 Agent – What Your Customers See

An Agent is the branded identity your customers interact with. It’s the verified business profile that appears inside the Messages app.

Agents include:

- Your brand name
- Your logo and color scheme
- Verified Google badge
- Optional contact info (call, email, web)

🧠 Customers see your agent name, not your phone number. Messages appear to come from your business — not a random shortcode or longcode.

### 🔢 Sender / Number – How the Message Gets Delivered

With SMS, the sender is the number (short code or long code) that a message is sent from. RCS is different. In RCS, messages are sent through an agent, not a number.

Some important details about senders and agents:

- Agents can be linked to a sender number behind the scenes -- If the recipient doesn’t support RCS, we can **automatically fall back to SMS** using the linked sender number.
- Agents can also be linked to a callable number that customers can call from the agent. See the image below for an example.

## What Agents Look Like

Agents are branded business profiles that appear in a user’s messaging app. There are quite a few details to an agent, so we've identified them below.

## Common Agent Use Cases

You can think of agents like micro-apps — each tailored to a use case. Some examples:

- Customer Support Agent  
  Branded support line with quick replies, links to help docs, and escalation options.
- Marketing Agent  
  Sends promos, product updates, carousels, or interactive campaigns (e.g. surveys or flash sales).
- Transactional Agent  
  Sends receipts, delivery updates, appointment confirmations, etc., all with smart buttons like “Track,” “Reschedule,” or “Get Help.”
- Multi-brand Platform?  
  You can register separate agents per brand, business unit, or region — all from a single platform.
