[RCS Business Messaging ](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging/guides/get-started/how-it-works)(RBM) is the modern evolution of SMS — a richer, interactive channel built into the default messaging apps on Android, and now increasingly available on iPhones in select markets.

With support for branded, app-like experiences and full conversational interactivity, RCS empowers businesses to connect with customers in a far more engaging way — no app installs, no redirects, no clunky mobile web.

Our RCS API is intended for the developers  who plan to integrate their systems with the Kudosity Messaging API to send RCS messages to their users and/or to build an RCS Conversation bot.

## Why It Matters — For You and Your Customers

If you're a developer building for internal stakeholders or client businesses, RCS unlocks powerful capabilities:

* **Verified by Google** – Messages come from your official, branded business profile, so customers know it’s really you.
* **Smart delivery fallback** – If RCS isn’t supported, we can automatically fall back and send via SMS — ensuring your messages get through.
* **Spam-free by design** – RCS traffic is tightly controlled and verified, avoiding the spam filters that increasingly block legitimate SMS.
* **Boost conversions** - with media-rich, action-oriented messages, customers are seeing high conversion rates. 2-3x higher than SMS!!
* **Simple API Integration**  - Clean, RESTful API to send and receive responses.
