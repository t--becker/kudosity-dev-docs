The best way to get immediate notification on the events like SMS delivery or incoming messages, is to set up callback URLs. We will notify this URL immediately after the event occurs and, if the call was unsuccessful, we will retry a few times later. We perform a GET request.

Callbacks can be set in several different places within your account.

- In the SETTINGS section of your account  
  Callbacks set there are the default for the account.
- In the send-sms API call  
  Callbacks for DLR and reply can be set as parameters when you make the send-sms call.
- Forward to URL in Inbound Options for a dedicated virtual number (Reply Callback)
- Forward to URL in Keyword Options (Reply Callback)Forward to URL in List Automation (List Action Callback)

## Callback Priority

Which callback URL is notified is prioritised as follows. Duplicate callbacks will not be sent.

1. send-sms call
2. Forward to URL on feature
3. Default URL in SETTINGS

If you are finding that a callback is not firing from SETTINGS or a Forward to URL. It is likely you have one set on the send-sms call.

## Callback Retries

If we should not be able to reach your configured http callback endpoint, we will retry the attempt a maximum of 4 times with an increasing delay of 1 minute, 5 minute, 1 hour and finally 24 hours.

## Delivery (DLR) Callback

DLR's or Delivery Receipts, are notifications received from the carriers relating to the success or otherwise of an attempted SMS Delivery. Your DLR Callback URL is the default URL we post incoming DLR's to. You can also set the DLR Callback URL separately for individual messages. This is done using a parameter on the send-sms call

Parameters we include in our delivery callback request:

[block:parameters]

  "data": {
    "h-0": "PARAMETER",
    "h-1": "DESCRIPTION",
    "0-0": "`message_id`",

## Reply Callback

Incoming SMS are broadly similar, with 2 subtly different forms:

- SMS Replies: are messages received 'in response' to an SMS message sent by you. Responses can come in on both the System Shared Number Pool or any Dedicated Virtual Number, and will be posted to the Callback URL above if there was no URL set as a parameter in the send-sms call.
- Inbound SMS: are messages that are received originating from a users mobile phone and are not in response to a message sent. Inbound SMS can only be received on a Dedicated Virtual Number and will only be posted to the Default URL supplied above.

Parameters we include in our reply callback request:

| PARAMETER      | DESCRIPTION                              |
