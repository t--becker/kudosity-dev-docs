title: Touchpoint CSV Report
excerpt: >-
  Returns a report of contacts included in the touchpoint contact list,
  including contact details, results, data, tracked link hits and conversation
  message history.


  **Filtering by date the contact was added:**


  - If neither `contact-start` or `contact-end` query parameters are provided,
  the response will include all contacts.
      
  - If only one of `contact-start` or `contact-end` query parameters is
  provided, the response will include contacts that were added to the touchpoint
  after the `contact-start` date or before the `contact-end` date.
      
  - If both `contact-start` and `contact-end` query parameters are provided, the
  response will only include contacts that were added to the touchpoint between
  those dates.
