The MMS endpoint in our API allows you to send multimedia messages (MMS) to recipients, enabling the inclusion of various media types such as images, audio, and video alongside your text messages. This endpoint is designed to facilitate rich communication by incorporating media content, making it ideal for marketing, notifications, and other multimedia communication needs.
